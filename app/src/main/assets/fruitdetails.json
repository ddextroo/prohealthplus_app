        "description": "Apple (Malus domestica), is a domesticated tree and fruit of the rose family (Rosaceae), one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits. Apples are grown mostly for their fresh fruit, but they are also used in the commercial sector to manufacture cans of apple butter, vinegar, juice, jam, and applesauce. Many of the world's harvests are also used to make brandy, wine, and cider. Fresh apples can be eaten either raw or cooked. There are numerous uses for cooked apples. One popular use is as a filling for pastries; the most common Filipino apple dishes are apple spring rolls, apple turon, and apple pie. Particularly in Europe, fried apples are usually served with recipes that call for sausage or pig. Apples are rich in carbohydrates, a good source of dietary fiber, and a good source of vitamins A and C.",

The banana is a fruit that grows in the tropics and is prized for its flavor, nutritional content, and year-round availability despite being consumed primarily in those regions. Cavendish, or dessert, bananas can be fried, mashed, and chilled in pies or puddings, but they are usually consumed fresh. They can also be added to breads, cakes, or muffins to flavor them. Plantains, also known as cooking varieties, are widely grown as a staple food source in tropical regions and are starchy rather than sweet. They are cooked when ripe or immature. A ripe fruit has a high content of dietary fiber, potassium, manganese, vitamins B6 and C, and up to 22 percent carbohydrates.",

Bananas arrived in China by 200 AD, where they were regarded as exotic. The pulp of the first wild bananas was sparse and the seeds were big and hard. Africans crossed the  Musa Acuminata  and  Musa Baalbisiana varieties to create the modern banana, which is seedless and more palatable, around 650 AD. After being considered strange and foreign for centuries, bananas became popular in the 20th century",

With its roots in the Andes of Peru and Bolivia, it is currently the world's most important food crop. As a cooked vegetable, potatoes are typically prepared whole or mashed. They are also ground into potato flour, which is used in baking and sauce thickening. Potatoes, which have a reputation for being highly digestible, are a good source of protein, thiamin, niacin, and vitamin C.  Potato stems grow underground stolons, which can grow to form multiple tubers of different sizes and shapes. Though they sometimes weigh more than 1.5 kg, tubers usually weigh no more than 300 grams. The starchy flesh can be white, yellow, or purple, and the skin can range in color from brownish white to deep purple. Growers can propagate desired traits through vegetative reproduction made easier by the spirally arranged buds (eyes) on tubers. Vegetative reproduction is widely used in commerce, but it reduces genetic diversity, making popular varieties more prone to illnesses and pests.",
        "history": "It is possible that potatoes were independently domesticated more than once; the Incas in South America were the main cultivators of potatoes some 1,800 years ago. Potatoes were brought to Europe by the Spanish invaders in the late 16th century, and by the end of the 17th century, they were a significant crop in Ireland. By the late 18th century, potatoes had spread throughout continental Europe, especially in Germany and the west of England. During the first forty years of the 19th century, the potato's influence grew even more on a global scale, and its importance to the Irish economy increased significantly. But catastrophic crop failures—most notably, the late blight (Phytophthora infestans) that caused the Irish Potato Famine in the middle of the 19th century—led to a more circumspect attitude toward reliance on potatoes.",

Economically significant orange species and varieties include the mandarin orange (Citrus reticulata), which is also known as the 'tangerine' variety; the China orange (Citrus ×sinensis), also known as the 'sweet' or 'common' orange; and the less common Seville orange (Citrus ×aurantium). Typical types of sweet oranges are the Israel-sourced Jaffa, the seedless navel, and the Maltese, or blood, orange.  Because orange trees are semi-dormant and can withstand temperatures just below freezing, oranges do well in areas that occasionally experience light frosts during the winter, unless an early frost interferes with the trees' yearly growth. Smudge pots or smokeless natural gas burners are used by orchards for heating in colder climates. Orange trees can grow in a variety of soil types, although in deep orchard soil, they prefer well-drained intermediate types. Orchards typically use trees budded on stocks that are grown from carefully chosen seeds, sown in a lath house, and moved to a nursery after a year. The trees, which are typically big enough for budding after 12 to 16 months in the nursery, are planted in the orchard when the budded tops are one to two years old.",

By the thirteenth century, carrots were farmed in China and northwest Europe, and during European colonization, wild carrot was inadvertently introduced as a weed to the United States. Nowadays, domesticated carrots (subspecies  D. carota sativus ) are widely planted in temperate regions. Carotene (provitamin A) is found in abundance in carrots, and its benefits were recognized in the 20th century, which led to a rise in the vegetable's popularity.",
        "history": "Carrots were originally domesticated in middle Asia (Kashmir or Punjab), but they later made their way to Near East Asia, then Europe, and China. Prior to being utilized as a food crop in the tenth and twelfth centuries, it was primarily utilized as a medicinal plant. In its natural state, the taproot is woody. On the other hand, the cultivated form's (subsp. sativus) root has become thicker and more succulent due to breeding and selection. Selections made in the seventeenth century for orange roots in Holland and later in France led to the creation of modern European cultivars.",
        "effects": "Excessive carrot consumption might cause carotenemia, a harmless skin discoloration resulting from high beta-carotene levels."

It belongs to the nightshade family, Solanaceae. Tomatoes are typically red when mature but can come in a variety of colors, including yellow, orange, green, and purple. They can be eaten raw, cooked, or processed into sauces, juices, and canned products.",
    "history": "The tomato is native to western South America and Central America. It was first domesticated by the indigenous peoples of Mexico. The Spanish brought the tomato to Europe in the early 16th century, where it initially met with suspicion due to its relation to the poisonous nightshade plants. Over time, it gained popularity in Mediterranean cuisine and spread worldwide. By the 18th century, tomatoes were widely cultivated in Europe and North America. Today, they are a staple in many cuisines and are cultivated globally.",
    "effects": "Some individuals may be allergic to tomatoes, experiencing symptoms like itching, swelling, and digestive discomfort. Tomatoes are acidic and can exacerbate symptoms of acid reflux or heartburn in sensitive individuals. Consuming large quantities of tomatoes may lead to gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea or abdominal pain due to their high fiber and acidity levels. As a member of the nightshade family, tomatoes contain solanine, a compound that can be toxic in very high amounts. However, the levels in tomatoes are generally safe for consumption."

    "description": "Bell pepper (Capsicum annuum) is a fruit of the nightshade family (Solanaceae). It is botanically a berry but is commonly considered a vegetable. Bell peppers come in various colors, including green, red, yellow, orange, and sometimes purple or brown. They have a crisp texture and a sweet, mild flavor, with green peppers being less ripe and slightly more bitter than their ripe, colorful counterparts. Bell peppers are used raw in salads, dips, and sandwiches, as well as cooked in stir-fries, sauces, and other dishes.",
    "history": "Bell peppers are native to Central and South America and have been cultivated for thousands of years. They were domesticated in Mexico and spread throughout the Americas by indigenous peoples. Bell peppers were brought to Europe by Spanish and Portuguese explorers in the 15th and 16th centuries and were later introduced to other parts of the world. Today, bell peppers are grown globally and are widely used in various cuisines for their vibrant colors, flavors, and nutritional benefits.",
    "effects": "Eating large amounts of bell peppers, particularly raw, may cause digestive discomfort such as bloating, gas, or indigestion, especially in individuals with sensitive digestive systems. Some individuals may be sensitive to nightshade vegetables like bell peppers, experiencing symptoms such as joint pain, inflammation, or digestive issues. Bell peppers can cause allergic reactions in some people, resulting in symptoms such as itching, swelling, hives, or respiratory issues. Conventionally grown bell peppers may contain pesticide residues, which can be harmful if consumed in large quantities over time. Washing bell peppers thoroughly before consumption or choosing organic options can help reduce exposure to pesticides."

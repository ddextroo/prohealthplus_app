        "description": "Apple (Malus domestica), is a domesticated tree and fruit of the rose family (Rosaceae), one of the most widely cultivated tree fruits. Apples are grown mostly for their fresh fruit, but they are also used in the commercial sector to manufacture cans of apple butter, vinegar, juice, jam, and applesauce. Many of the world's harvests are also used to make brandy, wine, and cider. Fresh apples can be eaten either raw or cooked. There are numerous uses for cooked apples. One popular use is as a filling for pastries; the most common Filipino apple dishes are apple spring rolls, apple turon, and apple pie. Particularly in Europe, fried apples are usually served with recipes that call for sausage or pig. Apples are rich in carbohydrates, a good source of dietary fiber, and a good source of vitamins A and C.",
        "history": "Native to the temperate zones of both hemispheres, Malus species (apples) are cultivated and thought to be domesticated from wild apples (M. sieversii), in the Tien Shan mountains of central Asia some 4,000-10,000 years ago. From there it traveled to western Europe through the Silk road and hybridized with a few wild crabapples, including M. baccata from Siberia, M. orientalis from the Caucasus, and M. sylvestris, the major secondary genetic contributor, from other parts of Europe.",

The banana is a fruit that grows in the tropics and is prized for its flavor, nutritional content, and year-round availability despite being consumed primarily in those regions. Cavendish, or dessert, bananas can be fried, mashed, and chilled in pies or puddings, but they are usually consumed fresh. They can also be added to breads, cakes, or muffins to flavor them. Plantains, also known as cooking varieties, are widely grown as a staple food source in tropical regions and are starchy rather than sweet. They are cooked when ripe or immature. A ripe fruit has a high content of dietary fiber, potassium, manganese, vitamins B6 and C, and up to 22 percent carbohydrates.",

Bananas arrived in China by 200 AD, where they were regarded as exotic. The pulp of the first wild bananas was sparse and the seeds were big and hard. Africans crossed the  Musa Acuminata  and  Musa Baalbisiana varieties to create the modern banana, which is seedless and more palatable, around 650 AD. After being considered strange and foreign for centuries, bananas became popular in the 20th century",

With its roots in the Andes of Peru and Bolivia, it is currently the world's most important food crop. As a cooked vegetable, potatoes are typically prepared whole or mashed. They are also ground into potato flour, which is used in baking and sauce thickening. Potatoes, which have a reputation for being highly digestible, are a good source of protein, thiamin, niacin, and vitamin C.\n\nPotato stems grow underground stolons, which can grow to form multiple tubers of different sizes and shapes. Though they sometimes weigh more than 1.5 kg, tubers usually weigh no more than 300 grams. The starchy flesh can be white, yellow, or purple, and the skin can range in color from brownish white to deep purple. Growers can propagate desired traits through vegetative reproduction made easier by the spirally arranged buds (eyes) on tubers. Vegetative reproduction is widely used in commerce, but it reduces genetic diversity, making popular varieties more prone to illnesses and pests.",
        "history": "It is possible that potatoes were independently domesticated more than once; the Incas in South America were the main cultivators of potatoes some 1,800 years ago. Potatoes were brought to Europe by the Spanish invaders in the late 16th century, and by the end of the 17th century, they were a significant crop in Ireland. By the late 18th century, potatoes had spread throughout continental Europe, especially in Germany and the west of England. During the first forty years of the 19th century, the potato's influence grew even more on a global scale, and its importance to the Irish economy increased significantly. But catastrophic crop failures—most notably, the late blight (Phytophthora infestans) that caused the Irish Potato Famine in the middle of the 19th century—led to a more circumspect attitude toward reliance on potatoes.",

Typical types of sweet oranges are the Israel-sourced Jaffa, the seedless navel, and the Maltese, or blood, orange.\n\nBecause orange trees are semi-dormant and can withstand temperatures just below freezing, oranges do well in areas that occasionally experience light frosts during the winter, unless an early frost interferes with the trees' yearly growth. Smudge pots or smokeless natural gas burners are used by orchards for heating in colder climates. Orange trees can grow in a variety of soil types, although in deep orchard soil, they prefer well-drained intermediate types. Orchards typically use trees budded on stocks that are grown from carefully chosen seeds, sown in a lath house, and moved to a nursery after a year. The trees, which are typically big enough for budding after 12 to 16 months in the nursery, are planted in the orchard when the budded tops are one to two years old.",
        "history": "Oranges are thought to have originated in tropical Asia, specifically in the Malay Archipelago. Through Roman conquests and Arab trade, orange cultivation spread to India, Africa, and the Mediterranean. Orange trees were widespread in the Canary Islands by the time of Columbus. They are now flourishing in many parts of the world. Oranges were once only used as dessert fruit, but as more people started drinking orange juice and realized how healthy it was, oranges became more and more popular. The main product produced in the US is frozen concentrated juice, with marmalade, candied peel, pectin, and essential oils as byproducts. Growers cultivate sour oranges for marmalade, and leftover fruit is fed to livestock. Due to their high vitamin C and A content, oranges remain a vital crop worldwide.",

        "description": "In the Apiaceae family, the edible taproot of the carrot ( Daucus carota ) is produced by a herbaceous, typically biennial plant. Root shapes vary among common varieties, with blunt or pointed lower ends and globular to long shapes. Variety with white, yellow, and purple flesh are known in addition to orange-colored roots.\n\nNative to Eurasia, wild carrot (subspecies  D. carota carota , also known as Queen Anne's lace) is believed to have been domesticated in Central Asia circa 1000 CE. Archaeological excavations have revealed prehistoric seeds, indicating that the plant was utilized medicinally prior to the domestication of its edible root. By the thirteenth century, carrots were farmed in China and northwest Europe, and during European colonization, wild carrot was inadvertently introduced as a weed to the United States. Nowadays, domesticated carrots (subspecies  D. carota sativus ) are widely planted in temperate regions. Carotene (provitamin A) is found in abundance in carrots, and its benefits were recognized in the 20th century, which led to a rise in the vegetable's popularity.",
        "history": "Carrots were originally domesticated in middle Asia (Kashmir or Punjab), but they later made their way to Near East Asia, then Europe, and China. Prior to being utilized as a food crop in the tenth and twelfth centuries, it was primarily utilized as a medicinal plant. In its natural state, the taproot is woody. On the other hand, the cultivated form's (subsp. sativus) root has become thicker and more succulent due to breeding and selection. Selections made in the seventeenth century for orange roots in Holland and later in France led to the creation of modern European cultivars.",
        "effects": "Excessive carrot consumption might cause carotenemia, a harmless skin discoloration resulting from high beta-carotene levels."
